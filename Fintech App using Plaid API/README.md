## **_Building a Fintech App on AWS Using the Plaid API_**

### Overview

Hello and welcome! My name is Cecilia, and in this amazing project, I will demonstrate how to build and deploy a demo fintech app on Amazon Web Services (AWS) using the using the [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/) framework and [Plaid](https://plaid.com/docs/link/) link API (application programming interface). 


AWS Amplify will enable us to quickly build a serverless web app with the following components:
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) (for front-end interface)
- [Amazon Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/) (for user sign-up/sign-in)
- [Amazon API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/)-based REST API
- [Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/)

Plaid is a financial services company and that helps fintech providers connect users securely to their bank accounts. In other words, it acts as a secure proxy between a fintech app and a bank. Plaid has connected over 12,000 banks and financial institutions throughout the world.using a single API! Today over 5,500 fintech apps use Plaid’s API to enable their users to access their bank accounts.

Fintech apps like Plaid offer a wide range of finance and banking interactions to users. This includes anything from payments to lending to trading. The concept of _Open Finance_ has been growing in popularity across the world. As the name suggests, "Open Finance" is a data-sharing model that refers to greater access to customer data through fintech apps (third-party apps). This include such as mortgages, savings accounts, retirement accounts, bills, payroll data, and more.

Fintech apps enhance the customer experience like never before. All that users need to do is simply link the app to their bank and/or brokerage accounts, and grant the necessary permissions. Due to the nature of fintech apps, they provide enhanced security features, such as multi-factor authentication and proof of identity.

The benefits of using Fintech apps include: making online payments for products using a “Buy Now Pay Later” plan, outlining monthly income and expense categories for budgeting, investing in crypto-assets, and more!

### Architectural Diagram

Here is an architectural diagram that summarizes the services and tools that are involved. This is a completely scalable and secure architecture which does not require the user to manage any server instances:

------------------------------------------------------------
### Pre-requisites

Before we begin, it is imperative that we have the software and tools installed, setup, and ready-to-go!

- Ensure that you have created a sandbox account at Plaid, and obtained your API keys. To achieve this, visit the [Plaid website](https://www.plaid.com) and then click `Get API Keys`.

![](./images/plaidwebsite.png)

- On the signup page, fill out your information, then select `create account`.

![](./images/createaccount.png)


- Next, install [AWS Amplify](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/start/install/) on your local PC.

- Lastly, create [AWS configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html#cli-configure-quickstart-config) profile by running the following command on your Terminal:

```
$ aws configure
```
- Be sure to enter the corresponding information when prompted:

![](./images/awsconfigure.png)

------------------------------------------------------------
### Getting Started

Now the fun begins!

- Begin by running the following commands to clone the Plaid demo app from Github:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-plaid-demo-app.git 
$ cd aws-plaid-demo-app
```

![](./images/gitclonecd.png)

- Next, begin the installation using the following command:

```
$ npm install
```
![](./images/npminstall.png)


**TROUBLESHOOTING**: If you do not have the `npm` command in your local pc, install Node JS (npm will be installed with Node):

```
$ brew install node
```

- Next, initialize a new Amplify project. When prompted, press `Enter/Return` on your keyboard, to accept the default.

```bash
$ amplify init
```

![](./images/amplifyinit.png)

- Next, you will be prompted with a series of questions. Provide the following answers for each prompt:


? Enter a name for the project `awsplaiddemoapp`

? Initialize the project with the above configuration? (Y/n) `Y`

? Select the authentication profile you want to use: (Use arrow keys) `AWS profile` 

? Please choose the profile you want to use: (Use arrow keys) `default`

_Your project has been successfully initialized and connected to the cloud!_

- **Add authentication**

```bash
$ amplify add auth 
```

? Do you want to use the default authentication configuration? `Default configuration`

? How do you want users to be able to sign in? (Use arrow keys and space bar to select) `Username`

### Testing the App

Let's test our newly created app! 

- Begin by navigating to the website URL that was displayed by the *amplify publish* command, and sign up as a new user. 

![](./images/httplink.png)


- Alternatively, you can find the website URL on the AWS Amplify service of the AWS management console. 


![](./images/awsamplifylink.png)

- After clicking on the website URL, create a new an account. Enter a username, password, email address and phone number. Be sure to check your email for the OTC (one time code) to verify your account.

![](./images/createaccount1.png)

- Next, after you sign in, click `Connect with Plaid`.

![](./images/bankconnect.png)

- Next, click `continue`

![](./images/plaidcxn.png)

- Select a bank from the list provided

![](./images/selectbank.png)

 - Next, use the following credentials to access the bank and display the transactions:

**username:** `user_good`
**password:** `pass_good`

![](./images/usergood.png)

- After you have entered your credentials, you should see a `success` page! Click `continue` to access the bank and display the transactions.

## Clean Up 

Nice work! Now we will begin the clean up process, so that we can prevent charges from prolonged usage of our resources.

- Navigate to the AWS Amplify service of the AWS management console to delete the demo app. 

![](./images/deleteapp.png)

- When prompted, confirm that you want to delete the app:

![](./images/deleteconfirm.png)

- It will take a few minutes for the app to delete. Please be patient!

![](./images/removingapp.png)


- The app will be deleted!
